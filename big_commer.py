#First, make sure you have installed the bigcommerce Python package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install bigcommerce

#Next, import the necessary modules:

import bigcommerce
import logging

#Set up logging so that you can see any error messages that are returned by the API:
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)


#Create an instance of the Bigcommerce class and authenticate with the API using your credentials:
api = bigcommerce.api.Bigcommerce(api_key='your_api_key', store_hash='your_store_hash', access_token='your_access_token')

#Now you can make API requests and debug any issues that arise. For example, if you wanted to retrieve a list of orders, you could use the following code:
orders = api.Orders.all()

#If there is an issue with your API credentials or with the request itself, you will see an error message in your terminal. For example, if your credentials are invalid, you might see a message like this:
ERROR:bigcommerce.api:Failed to authenticate with the Bigcommerce API: HTTPError(u'401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/your_store_hash/v3/orders')

#Once you have identified the issue, you can make any necessary changes and retry the request until it is successful.
That's an example of how to debug a RESTful API using Python and BigCommerce. Keep in mind that the specific steps may vary depending on the API you are working with and the issues you encounter.
